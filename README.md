## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is a single HTML file and requires no complex setup. The only prerequisite is running a local Ollama server.

### 1. Prerequisite: Install & Run Ollama

You must have Ollama installed and running on your machine.

1.  Download and install Ollama from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com/).
2.  Pull the `llama3` model. This is the model the app is configured to use.
    ```bash
    ollama pull llama3
    ```
3.  Ensure the Ollama server is running. The app is hardcoded to connect to `http://localhost:11434`, which is the default.

### 2. Run the Application

There is no web server to run. Simply **open the `index.html` file** in your web browser.

## üìñ How to Use

1.  **Add Job Description:** Paste the full job description into the text box on the left, or upload a .pdf/.docx file.
2.  **Upload Resumes:** Drag and drop one or more resumes (.pdf or .docx) into the upload area on the right.
3.  **Rank Resumes:** Click the "Rank Resumes" button.
4.  **Review Results:** The app will process all resumes and display:
    * A summary of the top-ranked candidates.
    * Comparative charts.
    * A detailed card for each candidate, sorted from highest to lowest score.
5.  **Get Details:**
    * Click on a candidate's card to expand it and load a more detailed analysis.
    * Click the **"‚ú® Gen. Questions"** button to generate tailored interview questions for that candidate.
    * Click **"View Resume"** to open the original resume file in a new tab.
